(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i\\'ve only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i\\'ll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\\\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\\\    Purdue Electrical Engineering']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Text Feature를 벡터화 시켜보기\n","#  - CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer 를 사용\n","\n","cnt_vect = CountVectorizer()\n","X_train_cnt_vect = cnt_vect.fit_transform(X_train)\n","X_test_cnt_vect  = cnt_vect.transform(X_test)"],"metadata":{"id":"ur0ilXfAJBJ5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696497685432,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":5125,"user":{"displayName":"SY Lee","userId":"15634914583474319987"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X_train_cnt_vect.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SKST1_eKJDva","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696497695029,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":378,"user":{"displayName":"SY Lee","userId":"15634914583474319987"}},"outputId":"d7af75f6-4e82-4c6d-fe1f-e6a805480757"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(11314, 101631)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","\n","lr_clf = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')\n","\n","lr_clf.fit(X_train_cnt_vect, y_train)\n","pred = lr_clf.predict(X_test_cnt_vect)\n","\n","accuracy_score(y_test, pred)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V3K1ApP0JHFg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696497816085,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":99364,"user":{"displayName":"SY Lee","userId":"15634914583474319987"}},"outputId":"580af3ff-0365-4a13-fee2-816aff161923"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.6167020711630377"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 예측할 때는 문장 또는 문서를 벡터화 시켜서 넣어야 한다.\n","predict_news_vect = cnt_vect.transform([\"SAN DIEGO — Money was flying and the clock was spinning when Mets General Manager Billy Eppler emerged from his suite late Wednesday afternoon on the final day of the winter meetings to announce that Justin Verlander indeed had signed a two-year, $86.6 million deal with the club.\"])\n","predict_news_vect"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KVujVrctJMpQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696497830272,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"SY Lee","userId":"15634914583474319987"}},"outputId":"b51b59f6-0129-4cff-9bf8-eeb2f0ad31a7"},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<1x101631 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'\n","\twith 41 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["lr_clf.predict(predict_news_vect)"],"metadata":{"id":"Uycee-XKJoXJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696497840750,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":485,"user":{"displayName":"SY Lee","userId":"15634914583474319987"}},"outputId":"f4bd1487-12f9-4c97-bc53-440d5a95871e","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([9])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"wVWIBW1LJqwo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
